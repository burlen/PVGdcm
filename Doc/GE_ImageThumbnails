7.1 IMAGE THUMBNAIL
 
PathSpeedâ"¢ PACS will create a thumbnail for each DICOM Image SOP Instance of
the following Photometric Interpretation values:
* MONOCHROME1 
* MONOCRHOEM2 
* RGB
 
The thumbnail is derived from the original pixel data by downscaling the image 
size to 128 Ã- 128 pixels or less, and added to the original SOP Instance 
with a private sequence data element in the DICOM Image SOP Instance.
 
One thumbnail is created per DICOM image. For a multi-frame image, 
only one thumbnail is created from the center frame. 
The number of the frame, which is used for the thumbnail creation is included in
the Image SOP Instance (see Section 7.3).
In PathSpeedâ"¢ PACS, the thumbnails are used by the PathSpeedâ"¢ Web 
display application for image navigation when browsing through a set of images.
 With the information  published in this Appendix, a DICOM application receiving
 the images from PathSpeedâ"¢ PACS can also explore the thumbnail data
encoded in the Image SOP Instances.
 
7.2 IMAGE THUMBNAIL COMPRESSION
 
The thumbnail is compressed with 8 bits or 12 bits JPEG lossy compression 
format, depending on the stored pixel depth of the original images.
For all Image SOP Instances with bits stored equal to or less then 8, 
the thumbnail image is stored one
byte per pixel and compressed by JPEG 8-bits lossy compression.
For all Image SOP Instances with bits stored equal to or less 12, 
the thumbnail image is stored two bytes per pixel and compressed 
by JPEG 12-bits lossy compression.
For all Image SOP Instances with bits stored greater than 12, the pixel data of
 the thumbnail image id first shifted to fit into the 12 bits scope and then 
 stored two bytes per pixel
The thumbnail is compressed by JPEG 12-bits lossy compression. 
The bits shifted is saved in the GE Private Image Thumbnail Sequence, 
as specified in the next section.
All thumbnails are represented in the unsigned format (either byte or two-bytes
 (12 bits) integer). 
 If an Image SOP Instance contains a signed pixel data element, the thumbnail 
 pixel  data will be offset to the unsigned scope. 
The offset added is saved in the GE Private Image Thumbnail  Sequence, 
as specified in the next section.

7.3 IMAGE THUMBNAIL ENCODING
 
PathSpeedâ"¢ PACS adds a private sequence data element (GE Private Image 
Thumbnail Sequence) to an Image SOP Instance for the thumbnail encoding. 
There is no any change  to the existing data attributes of the SOP Instance.
The GE Private Image Thumbnail Sequence is specified in the following table.

TABLE 
7-1: SPECIFICATION OF GE PRIVATE IMAGE THUMBNAIL SEQUENCE
 
The GE Private Image Thumbnail Sequence includes a number of standard data 
elements directly copied from the original Image SOP Instance, 
to which the sequence is added. 
These data elements are marked as Copy from the original SOP Instance in 
Table 7-1. 
These data elements provide the original pixel data context from that 
the thumbnail has been derived. Note that they do not contain the values 
specific to the thumbnail.
The GE Private Image Thumbnail Sequence uses a number of standard data elements
 to describe the properties of the thumbnail pixel data. 
 Note that these data elements  in this sequence really contain the values 
 specific to the thumbnail, but not to the original image pixel data
