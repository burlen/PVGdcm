Quote:
For completeness, there are three ways an application can
correlate CT and PET (or other sets) using DICOM only:

1) Code all the images with the same Frame of Reference UID.
At least one major vendor does this now.

2) Make assumptions based on specific implementation behavior
based on data elements that match (e.g. perhaps Study Time, or
matching values in the General Equipment Module).
Without actual trial and experience verifying the correlation,
I agree, that an assumption is not wise

3) Use the recent Supplement 73 Spatial Registration Storage SOP Classes.
This capability allows explicitly specifying the spatial transformation
from one Frame of Reference to another. However, this supplement
is probably too recent to be in use.

WG 17 is considering the matter of registration of images
in 3D, including rigid (and probably non-rigid) body
transformations. This effort has been prioritized over
WG 17's other work on multi-dimensional representation
as a consequence of the prevalence of PET-CT fusion
applications. See:

Adding comment by Doug Sluis (dsluis at clinical-knowledge.com)
To your numbered questions:
1.  Yes they are separate SOP Instances. (What is alternative?)
2. Yes. (although the recent Spatial Registration SOP Class is a possible option)

There is no guarantee that CT and PET slices are one-to-one or
that the slices are spatially coincident. Attempts to spatially sort
may not succeed.
